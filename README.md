# Python Crash Course

## What and Why

Python is a great language for automation and simplify lots of tasks, that's why I decided to create this simple crash course to anyone who wants to learn quick the ways of the snake. All you need its a basic programming knowledge and read carefully the codes for the comments.

***Do your own testing and change the code***, that's the true learning path, research, test, and have fun!
